    "text": "Getting to the source\nBut the media can only report on what it knows. When it comes to crime, the source and gatekeeper of most information is the police. If there was a bias in their communications, chances are we might see this bias appear on the other side of the information pipeline - the media. That’s what I was thinking when I was working for the German Press Agency (dpa) a couple of years ago, covering (among other things) crime in the state of Brandenburg. At this time I was reading a lot of these press releases and got the impression there might be something wrong with their portrayal of foreign perpetrators.\nIn fact, there’s evidence from other states suggesting that might be exactly the case. In 2021, a team of journalists collected millions of police press releases from ten states. They showed a systemic bias: Two out of three press releases that disclosed the alleged perpetrator’s or the victim’s nationality were about foreigners.\nBut there was a catch. Some states, like Brandenburg, don’t use the centralised news feed the journalists used to collect the data, and were thus exempted from any scrutiny. The investigation did also not provide a lot of details. We learned that the police press reports in the investigation overproportionally featured foreign nationals, but not if they tended to be the suspects or the victims of these crimes."

I scraped the press archive for the police of the state of Brandenburg, collecting round about 120 000 press releases that span more than 14 years of police work. Then I used AI to systematically analyze their work. How I managed to do that is going to be the topic of the next two to three posts."
